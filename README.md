# ALMA-radio_galaxy_project

The Python modules in this repository carry out an analysis of ALMA mm/sub-mm interferometric datacubes of seven different distant radio galaxies. The aim is to provide a worked example of narrow-band image visualisation and spectral line-fitting on data from an ALMA datacube.
